1. Pull out the greatest common factor (GCF)

2. Factor by grouping: (A method to look for if there are four terms in the expression)

3. Factor quadratics: (A quadratic expression is a polynomial expression of degree 2, which can be written in the standard form ax^2+bx+c. The coefficient a must be non zero for it to be quadratic expression, otherwise it would be a linear expression.

4. Difference of squares.

5. Difference or sum of cubes.
    a. a^3 + b^3 = (a+b) (a^2-ab+b^2)
    b. a^3 - b^3 = (a-b) (a^2+ab+b^2)
